Description: 

This is basically a very simple Python hashing program that was developed in under thirty minutes.

It allows you to enter in a password and it will return the password with a variety of outputs from different hashing algorithms such as SHA256, MD5, SHA512 etc. 

LICENSING: 

This project is entirely open-source as I don't have anything that hasn't been used before in there. Feel free to use it, just don't make money off of the product. 


I believe that's everything, 

Thanks Matt.
